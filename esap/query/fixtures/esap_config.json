Calibration solutions, including bandpass, residual delays, complex gains, and polarization angle and leakage, are derived for each beam using CASA. These solutions are applied to the target dataset. A phase-only self-calibration is performed on a frequency-averaged version of the target dataset for every beam. An amplitude and phase self-calibration is also undertaken; this is accepted if it significantly improves data quality. The final self-calibrated data is used to produce a multi-frequency synthesis image. The final image is cleaned down to a 1\u03c3-level within masks generated with a 5\u03c3-threshold, where \u03c3 is the calculated theoretical noise of the observation. In addition, continuum chunk images over 25 MHz are produced by the pipeline. Continuum subtraction is done in the uv-plane using the final continuum model produced above. The continuum-subtracted data is broken into spectral windows The lowest redshift spectral window is retained at full spectral resolution; all other spectral windows undergo a three-channel averaging. A dirty line cube (no source finding or cleaning) is then produced for each spectral window. The final self-calibrated data is averaged to 6.25 MHz. These averaged visibilities are used to produces Stokes Q and U cubes, plus a Stokes V multi-frequency synthesis image.",

In order to obtain high-level data products, additional processing steps are needed. For interferometric data, the first standard data processing step is called the \u2018Pre-processing pipeline\u2019. The Pre-processing pipeline flags the data in time and frequency and optionally averages them in time and/or frequency. It can also be used to subtract the brightest sources in the sky (the so-called 'A-team' sources) from the visibilities through the 'demixing' algorithm, and to compress the uv data with Dysco. For the vast majority of interferometric observations, this step is performed by the Radio Observatory and the pre-processed data are made available on the archive. The software that performs this step is the Default Pre-Processing Pipeline (DPPP). The Pulsar Pipeline (PulP; Stappers et al. 2011) is the standard processing tool used by the RO for LOFAR pulsar observations.",
