      over a bandwidth of 300 MHz, which can be placed in the frequency range 1130-1750
      MHz. The data is taken in full Stokes mode, and the combination of bandwidth
      and spectral resolution means that the Apertif imaging data are simultaneously
      sensitive continuum, polarization,and neutral hydrogen (H i) data.
    retrieval_description: "The raw visibility data are automatically ingested into
      ALTA after completion of an observation. The visibilities are recorded in measurement-set
      (MS) format. With 24576 channels, 12 dishes,\r\n40 beams, and 30 second integration,
      the size of a typical survey field (11.5 hour observation) is 4.6TB. Calibrator
      observations have 10 second integrations and vary from 4–5 minutes on source,
      resulting in a datasize of 83.2–104 GB per calibrator observation. Since a calibrator
      is placed in every beam, a total\r\ncalibration scan (40 beams) results in 3.3–4.2
      TB of data stored on ALTA. In order to minimize data volumes, the unnecessary
      data for each calibration observation (i.e., the 39 beams without\r\na calibrator)
      are deleted from ALTA after the generation of in spection plots. This procedure
      is called \"pruning\" and results in a total size of 83.2–104 GB for each full
      calibrator scan.\r\nIn addition to the raw data itself, inspection plots are
      generated for a quick look at the quality of the data."

    short_description: Imaging Survey Processed Data
    long_description: Imaging Survey data products are produced from running through
      the imaging pipeline, Apercal. This pipeline flagged the data, derived cross-calibration
      solutions, found self-calibration solutions from the target data, and produced
      multi-frequency synthesis continuum images and dirty, non-continuum-subtracted
      line cubes over the frequency range 1400-1420 MHz.
    retrieval_description: Apercal is publicly available via github. The re-processing
      of data first retrieves the raw data from the Apertif Long Term Archive (ALTA),
      then applies manual flags to the data, including flagging subband edges and
      for shadowing, and runs AOFlagger to identify and flag RFI. Calibration solutions,
      including bandpass, residual delays, complex gains, and polarization angle and
      leakage, are derived for each beam using CASA. These solutions are applied to
      the target dataset. A phase-only self-calibration is performed on a frequency-averaged
      version of the target dataset for every beam. An amplitude and phase self-calibration
      is also undertaken; this is accepted if it significantly improves data quality.
      The final self-calibrated data is used to produce a multi-frequency synthesis
      image. The final image is cleaned down to a 1σ-level within masks generated
      with a 5σ-threshold, where σ is the calculated theoretical noise of the observation.
      In addition, continuum chunk images over 25 MHz are produced by the pipeline.
      Continuum subtraction is done in the uv-plane using the final continuum model
      produced above. The continuum-subtracted data is broken into spectral windows
      The lowest redshift spectral window is retained at full spectral resolution;
      all other spectral windows undergo a three-channel averaging. A dirty line cube
      (no source finding or cleaning) is then produced for each spectral window. The
      final self-calibrated data is averaged to 6.25 MHz. These averaged visibilities
      are used to produces Stokes Q and U cubes, plus a Stokes V multi-frequency synthesis
      image.

      imaging pipeline, long baseline pipeline, pulsar pipeline, dynamic spectra.
      In order to obtain high-level data products, additional processing steps are
      needed. For interferometric data, the first standard data processing step is
      called the ‘Pre-processing pipeline’. The Pre-processing pipeline flags the
      data in time and frequency and optionally averages them in time and/or frequency.
      It can also be used to subtract the brightest sources in the sky (the so-called
      'A-team' sources) from the visibilities through the 'demixing' algorithm, and
      to compress the uv data with Dysco. For the vast majority of interferometric
      observations, this step is performed by the Radio Observatory and the pre-processed
      data are made available on the archive. The software that performs this step
      is the Default Pre-Processing Pipeline (DPPP). The Pulsar Pipeline (PulP; Stappers
      et al. 2011) is the standard processing tool used by the RO for LOFAR pulsar
      observations.

    short_description: TAP -  Table Access Protocol
    long_description: The table access protocol (TAP) defines a service protocol for
      accessing general table data, including astronomical catalogs as well as general
      database tables. Access is provided for both database and table metadata as
      well as for actual table data. This version of the protocol includes support
      for multiple query languages, including queries specified using the Astronomical
      Data Query Language ADQL within an integrated interface. It also includes support
      for both synchronous and asynchronous queries. Special support is provided for
      spatially indexed queries using the spatial extensions in ADQL. A multi-position
      query capability permits queries against an arbitrarily large list of astronomical
      targets, providing a simple spatial cross-matching capability. More sophisticated
      distributed cross-matching capabilities are possible by orchestrating a distributed
      query across multiple TAP services.

    short_description: Simple Image Access  (SIA)
    long_description: The Simple Image Access protocol (SIA) provides capabilities
      for the discovery, description, access, and retrieval of multi-dimensional image
      datasets, including 2-D images as well as datacubes of three or more dimensions.
      SIA data discovery is based on the ObsCore Data Model (ObsCoreDM), which primarily
      describes data products by the physical axes (spatial, spectral, time, and polarization).
      Image datasets with dimension greater than 2 are often referred to as datacubes,
      cube or image cube datasets and may be considered examples of hypercube or n-cube
      data. In this document the term “image” refers to general multi-dimensional
      datasets and is synonymous with these other terms unless the image dimensionality
      is otherwise specified. SIA provides capabilities for image discovery and access.
      Data discovery and metadata access (using ObsCoreDM) are defined here. The capabilities
      for drilling down to data files (and related resources) and services for remote
      access are defined elsewhere, but SIA also allows for direct access to retrieval.

    short_description: Table Access Protocol (SSA)
    long_description: 'The Simple Spectral Access (SSA) Protocol (SSAP) defines a
      uniform interface to remotely discover and access one dimensional spectra. SSA
      is a member of an integrated family of data access interfaces altogether comprising
      the Data Access Layer (DAL) of the IVOA. SSA is based on a more general data
      model capable of describing most tabular spectrophotometric data, including
      time series and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) as well as 1-D spectra;
      however the scope of the SSA interface as specified in this document is limited
      to simple 1-D spectra, including simple aggregations of 1-D spectra. The form
      of the SSA interface is simple: clients first query the global resource registry
      to find services of interest and then issue a data discovery query to selected
      services to determine what relevant data is available from each service; the
      candidate datasets available are described uniformly in a VOTable format document
      which is returned in response to the query. Finally, the client may retrieve
      selected datasets for analysis. Spectrum datasets returned by an SSA spectrum
      service may be either precomputed, archival datasets, or they may be virtual
      data which is computed on the fly to respond to a client request. Spectrum datasets
      may conform to a standard data model defined by SSA, or may be native spectra
      with custom project-defined content. Spectra may be returned in any of a number
      of standard data formats. Spectral data is generally stored externally to the
      VO in a format specific to each spectral data collection; currently there is
      no standard way to represent astronomical spectra, and virtually every project
      does it differently. Hence spectra may be actively mediated to the standard
      SSA-defined data model at access time by the service, so that client analysis
      programs do not have to be familiar with the idiosyncratic details of each data
      collection to be accessed.'

    short_description: Apertif DR1
    long_description: Imaging Survey data products are produced from running through
      the imaging pipeline, Apercal. This pipeline flagged the data, derived cross-calibration
      solutions, found self-calibration solutions from the target data, and produced
      multi-frequency synthesis continuum images and dirty, non-continuum-subtracted
      line cubes over the frequency range 1400-1420 MHz.
    retrieval_description: Apercal is publicly available via github. The re-processing
      of data first retrieves the raw data from the Apertif Long Term Archive (ALTA),
      then applies manual flags to the data, including flagging subband edges and
      for shadowing, and runs AOFlagger to identify and flag RFI. Calibration solutions,
      including bandpass, residual delays, complex gains, and polarization angle and
      leakage, are derived for each beam using CASA. These solutions are applied to
      the target dataset. A phase-only self-calibration is performed on a frequency-averaged
      version of the target dataset for every beam. An amplitude and phase self-calibration
      is also undertaken; this is accepted if it significantly improves data quality.
      The final self-calibrated data is used to produce a multi-frequency synthesis
      image. The final image is cleaned down to a 1σ-level within masks generated
      with a 5σ-threshold, where σ is the calculated theoretical noise of the observation.
      In addition, continuum chunk images over 25 MHz are produced by the pipeline.
      Continuum subtraction is done in the uv-plane using the final continuum model
      produced above. The continuum-subtracted data is broken into spectral windows
      The lowest redshift spectral window is retained at full spectral resolution;
      all other spectral windows undergo a three-channel averaging. A dirty line cube
      (no source finding or cleaning) is then produced for each spectral window. The
      final self-calibrated data is averaged to 6.25 MHz. These averaged visibilities
      are used to produces Stokes Q and U cubes, plus a Stokes V multi-frequency synthesis
      image.
